# 👾 Offensive Kernel Security Engineer & Platform Security Roadmap
> I’m building a repeatable path from foundations ➜ kernel internals ➜ exploit development ➜ fuzzing & CVE research.  
> Primary hypervisor: **Proxmox VE**. Lab-first, publish-later, responsibly-disclosed research.

## About
This repo contains a structured, timeboxed plan for becoming an **Offensive Kernel Security Engineer**. It pairs focused learning goals with lab exercises, starter projects, and publication targets (writeups, PoCs, patches). Use it as a personal curriculum or follow along and contribute.

---

## How to use this repo
- Read the **Roadmap** for the high-level plan.  
- Pick a lab from `/labs` and follow the lab README. Each lab is self-contained and reproducible in a VM.  
- Use Issues to track progress and Projects (kanban) to move items from *Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done*.  
- Follow the `CONTRIBUTING.md` before opening PRs or adding labs.

---

## Roadmap (high level)
- **Horizon I**: Foundations — Linux, C, Assembly, scripting, basic fuzzing.  
- **Horizon II**: Kernel internals — LKMs, debugging, kernel subsystems, ARM basics.  
- **Horizon III**: Exploitation — kernel UAFs, race bugs, ROP, payload engineering.  
- **Horizon IV**: Research & disclosure — fuzz campaigns, CVE reproductions, upstream contributions.

---

## Horizons & Milestones (detailed)
See `/roadmap/horizons.md` for a week-by-week breakdown, tasks, and success criteria.

**Quick milestone examples**
- M1: `lkm-hello` module: build + load + README (Horizon I, week 1)  
- M2: `fuzz-utils` harness: AFL++ target + crash-capture (Horizon I, week 2)  
- M3: Kernel debug flow: QEMU + GDB walk-through and crash triage (Horizon II, week 6)  
- M4: PoC exploit for public CVE (lab-only, responsibly disclosed) (Horizon IV)

---

## Proxmox Offensive Lab Blueprint
A short lab checklist is in `/labs/proxmox/README.md`. Key points:
- Host: Proxmox VE (dedicated mini-PC).  
- VMs: Kali (attacker), Ubuntu (target), Windows (target), minimal custom-kernel VM.  
- Storage: NVMe for VM images, snapshots for safe recovery.  
- Tools: Ghidra, radare2, gdb/kgdb, QEMU, pwndbg, AFL++, syzkaller.

---

## Starter labs & Projects (pick one)
- `/labs/00-lkm-hello` — Minimal kernel module (Hello world) with Makefile and test script.  
- `/labs/01-fuzz-harness` — Small C program designed for AFL++ with `run_fuzz.sh`.  
- `/projects/fuzzforge` — Scaffold for a custom fuzzer or harness.  
- `/writeups` — Publish lab results and triage notes.

## Contribution & Code of Conduct
Contributions are welcome. Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` before submitting PRs or issues. This repo is for **research & education only** — do not publish exploit code targeting active systems without responsible disclosure.
